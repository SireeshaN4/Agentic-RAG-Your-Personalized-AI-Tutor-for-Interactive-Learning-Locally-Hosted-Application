    "title1": "**Introduction**\\n\\n* The paper discusses the importance of prompt engineering in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\\n* Prompt engineering involves designing input sequences that elicit specific responses from language models.\\n\\n",
    "title2": "**Background and Related Work**\\n\\n* The authors review existing work on prompt engineering, including chain-of-thought prompting, program-of-thought prompting, and tool augmentation.\\n* They highlight the limitations of current approaches, such as relying on human judgment or using pre-defined templates.\\n\\n",
    "title3": "**Methodology**\\n\\n* The authors propose a new approach called \"Toolformer\" that uses a combination of transformer-based models and attention mechanisms to generate prompts.\\n* Toolformer involves training a model to predict the most effective prompt sequence for a given task, based on the model\\'s understanding of the task and its requirements.\\n\\n",
    "title4": "**Experiments and Results**\\n\\n* The authors conduct experiments using various tasks, including question answering, text classification, and language translation.\\n* They evaluate the performance of Toolformer against state-of-the-art models in each task.\\n\\n",
    "title5": "**Discussion and Conclusion**\\n\\n* The authors discuss the implications of their work for the development of autonomous agents that can interact with humans through NLP interfaces.\\n* They highlight the potential benefits of using prompt engineering to improve the performance and flexibility of language models.\\n\\nOverall, this paper appears to be a research report on the topic of prompt engineering in NLP tasks, with a focus on developing new approaches to designing effective prompts for language models.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'llama3.2:1b', 'created_at': '2025-01-05T15:09:38.368791341Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 82068887667, 'load_duration': 32005199, 'prompt_eval_count': 2048, 'prompt_eval_duration': 40821000000, 'eval_count': 336, 'eval_duration': 41213000000, 'message': Message(role='assistant', content='', images=None, tool_calls=None)} id='run-1d3a3e92-2969-404a-b282-69081459e532-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2048, 'output_tokens': 336, 'total_tokens': 2384}"
